I created the project to help me automate some excel spreadsheet changes that would normally take me hours and days to complete. This does it in a matter of seconds. It also helps create a bar chart of the data. Row C is multiplied by 0.9 and the answer is put in Row D. So instead of memanually computing the values, this python code allows me to automatew the process and produce a bar chart.
